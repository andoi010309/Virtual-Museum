	<h2><mark>WHAT IS THIS?</mark></h2>
	<p align="center">The "Eastern Visayas Regional Science High School U.P.G.R.A.D.E.D (Upgraded Platform for Gathered Real Accessed Data via Electronic Dissemination): Virtual Museum Prototype", is a website developed by Grade 10 student researchers.
	<h2><mark>WHAT IS OUR GOAL?</mark></h2>
	<p>This website was developed with the goal to promote the  publicity and heritage of the school, along with its newly established school campus located in the bustling city of Catbalogan.</p>
	<h2><mark>WHY?</mark></h2>
	<p>The recent trend of virtual museums have been steadily rising, gradually becoming the revolutionized approach for showcasing a specific location and promoting its public outreach. The booming development of EVRSHS simultaneously coincides with this recent trend, therefore, we, the researchers, decided to develop a prototype of what a virtual museum of this prestigious school would look like.</p>
	<p>This project was created for research purposes. However, we hope this website will be the first stepping stone to the creation of a full-blown virtual museum, treading the path for innovative thinking and creative ideas.</p>
