This is a Virtual Museum Website (Prototype), a virtual tour of the EVRSHS New Campus for our research-10.

Just to remind you that this website will still have a constant update due to our research was accepted and being continued.
further more, the website developer does have a slight passion on making progress with this website and is currently making things more high quality and optimized.

[In a mean time, theres currently no updates. Just taking some long break]
[Update - 7/29/2025: Currently Learning python for back-end and probably front-end aswell(its optional, only for creating app thats it)]
[Update - 8/28/2025: Just checked all of my coding formats after quite a long python learning session, and holy sh8. just how terible my coding was,
ts is straight chaotic to look at. now i have to try an simplify it but goddamn theres allat to redo]

+Upcoming changes
--panorama Krpano (depends if the current panorama panellum is actually giving a sign of performance issue)

The web developer is not an expert but can still adapt through trial and error.
