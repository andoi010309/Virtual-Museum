Good news, ive learned the pannellum library's functionally, syntax, and its adjustment, this took me like 5 hours (which ended at 1 AM)[foreshadowing].
the thing you suggested me within the panorama is:
 -Adding mouseover (hover) that can technically show up a text information which is Possible to add 
  (but its not much of a quality with its hightlight shape, the "object" upon hovering over. Instead, it will be shown as a "i" symbol)
   really unfortunate ik, its possible but it requires more javascripting and im not entirely expert at doing so.

Slight issue:
 -scene changing dont seem to work, although it is trying to render the next panorama when clicking the next panorama button
  -updated: apparently the autoLoad = "true" makes the primary/first scene (panorama) Locked, its like "while the statement is true, then keep doing it". 
   (Total use of time is 7 hours = almost 3 AM)[Like i knew the autoLoad makes it a repeating to load/render 
   (i had this sense due to familiarizing the so-called "infinite-loop" error on C++ with the do-while statement) 
    but i just ended up having long ahh time looking at other line of code for what was main issue]

(Reminder for taking a Photsphere)
-there is no limit on making one
-and i mean every single position/place neeeded to be captured as Photosphere
-im really sorry but we do need it for proper movement so that the users dont get lost
-and if the room/place is restricted then you can just continue other appropriate place











+ Pannellum's function and its syntax.
 - Hotspots: mainly for adding buttons inside the panorama (responsive positioning)
 - sceneId: used to identify which scene needed to be rendered
 - panorama: used for linking the panorama file (mostly required file path if its separated to its folder)



the pitch and yaw within the hotSpots is for adjusting its original position (they are responsive from the user's input drag)
