Good news, ive learned the pannellum library's functionally, syntax, and its adjustment, this took me like 5 hours (which ended at 1 AM).
the thing you suggested me within the panorama is:
 -Adding mouseover (hover) that can technically show up a text information which is Possible to add 
  (but its not much of a quality with its hightlight shape, the "object" upon hovering over. Instead, it will be shown as a "i" symbol) really unfortunate ik, its possible but it requires more javascripting and im not entirely expert at doing so.

Slight issue:
 -scene changing dont seem to work, although it is trying to render the next panorama when clicking the next panorama button


+ Pannellum's function and its syntax.
 - Hotspots: mainly for adding buttons inside the panorama (responsive positioning)
 - sceneId: used to identify which scene needed to be rendered
 - panorama: used for linking the panorama file (mostly required file path if its separated to its folder)


The Syntax:
"hotSpots": [
    {
        // Hotspot 1 properties
    },
    {
        // Hotspot 2 properties
    },
    // ... more hotspots ...
]

The Full Syntax:

"example": {                                 // sceneId: "example"
            "type": "equirectangular",
            "panorama": "Sources/Room2.jpg", //panorama file
            "hotSpots": [
                {
                    "pitch": 10,
                    "yaw": -150,
                    "type": "scene",
                    "text": "Return to MidPoint",
                    "sceneId": "MidPoint",   //a function that leads/render to another sceneId
                    "cssClass": "nav-hotspot"
                },
                {
                    "pitch": -5, //a vertical angle adjustment
                    "yaw": 120,
                    "type": "info",  //type of the button (there are only two options, such as INFO and SCENE, as a default choices.)
                    "text": "Ancient artifacts exhibit.", // a text information upon hovering the button
                    "cssClass": "info-hotspot" //a class for css (styling)
                }
            ]
        }
    },



the pitch and yaw within the hotSpots is for adjusting its original position (they are responsive from the user's input drag)
